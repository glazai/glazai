# 👋 Hi there, I’m George — Cybersecurity Enthusiast | Blue Team Focused | Python Coder

I'm a cybersecurity professional with a background in incident response, phishing detection, and log analysis. My passion lies in building tools that detect threats, analyze suspicious behavior, and map activity to frameworks like MITRE ATT&CK. I’m currently building a hands-on portfolio that demonstrates real-world skills — one Python script at a time.

## 👨‍💻 About Me

🔭 I’m currently working on:
- **PhishyMail**: A phishing detection tool that uses NLP and rules to flag suspicious emails
- **MITRE ATT&CK Mapping Project**: Detecting TTPs through log analysis and mapping findings
- **Wine Stock Manager**: A Python GUI app for managing catering stock data (because I like wine too 🍷)

👯 I’m looking to collaborate on:
- Cybersecurity tools (SIEM, detection rules, phishing detection, alert automation)
- Blue team educational resources or beginner-friendly open source projects

🤝 I’m looking for help with:
- Building smarter phishing detection logic (e.g., ML models, feature engineering)
- Writing or improving Sigma/YARA detection rules

🌱 I’m currently learning:
- **CompTIA Security+** – studying through TryHackMe and Professor Messer
- Cloud security fundamentals, and deepening my Python scripting skills for infosec

💬 Ask me about:
- Threat detection, phishing indicators, log analysis, MITRE ATT&CK, or transitioning to cybersecurity from non-tech roles

⚡ Fun fact:
I used to manage a team of 15 in a college dining hall — now I manage detection rules, Python loops, and suspicious `.eml` files 😄

## 🔨 Featured Projects

### 🔐 [PhishyMail](https://github.com/glazai/phishymail)
> A Python-based phishing email detector that analyzes `.eml` files for threats.

- Rule-based engine with NLP (urgency detection, spoofing, suspicious URLs, etc.)
- Risk scoring and severity tagging
- Supports regex pattern matching and user-defined blacklist rules
- Detects HTML `<form>` elements and verifies SPF/DKIM headers

### 📊 [Log Analysis & MITRE ATT&CK Mapping](https://github.com/glazai/MITRE-ATTACK-Detection)
> Parses logs and detects suspicious activity, mapping to ATT&CK TTPs (e.g., T1053.005 – Scheduled Tasks)

- Parses system logs (CSV, JSON)
- Detects key threat behaviors using rule logic
- Outputs visual summaries of mapped techniques
